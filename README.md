CRM
===
- Over simplified CRM application using Spring Boot.


Workflow
========
- To compile the entire project, run "mvn install".
- To run integration tests, run "mvn verify".
- To run the application, run "mvn spring-boot:run" and open http://localhost:8080.

To develop the theme, simply update the relevant theme files and reload the application.
Pre-compiling a theme eliminates automatic theme updates at runtime - see below for more information.
